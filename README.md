Notes on Conversion:

1. Some slides are flagged as headers in TOC but the slides are formatted differently (i.e. left-right for summary, while actually a title-slide)

2a. Are full-image slides default?

2. Question slides need to be denoted somehow

3. Need to break out the content into separate fields to make the data able to be generated by direct edits to files and not HTML

4. Need revised template files for each file type

5. Need to find full list of types and variables before refactoring:
    - Types: 
        title-break, 
        full-image, 
        left-right, ???

    - Variables:
        title : String - header title
        slideId : String - contains nav index
        type : String - must match one of the types above
