title: Understanding Mining
slideId: block-example
type: example
goal: "The purpose of this activity is to show how decentralized networks made up of competing miners reach network consensus."
details: |
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <span class="handsOnParagraph">In this scenario, we are going to slow down the mining race between two miners. Each miner has a copy of Charlie’s transaction for the block they are going to compile. Whichever miner that wins the race has included Charlie’s transaction in the block they are creating. No matter which miner wins, Charlie’s transaction gets included in the blockchain. The transactions compiled by non-winning miners are sent back to the mempool until they are added into a block by another miner.</span>
    <h3>Discussion Points</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Who determines which transactions get added to the block?</li>
      <li>What happens if my transaction does not get mined?</li>
      <li>What happens to Charlie's transaction if it is not immediately included in a block?</li>
    </ul>
